   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   BundleTransformer.Less contains translator-adapter `LessTranslator` 
   (supports LESS (http://lesscss.org) version 1.4.2). This adapter makes
   translation of LESS-code to CSS-code. Also contains debugging 
   HTTP-handler `LessAssetHandler`, which is responsible for text output 
   of translated LESS-asset.
   
   As a JS-engine is used the JavaScript Engine Switcher library 
   (http://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher). For correct 
   working of this module is recommended to install one of the following 
   NuGet packages: JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie or 
   JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8.
